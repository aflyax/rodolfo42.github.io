Actually, Yahoo isn't Google because it just isn't. But the title is here just to draw your attention :D

Recently, I've tried to create a Flickr account, and they require me to create a Yahoo account. How bad can it be, right?

At the Yahoo login page, I was surprised to see I could actually login into Yahoo with my Google account (yeih!). So I gave it a try and, as expected, my e-mail wasn't recognized, but it's all good, I just filled all the information to sign up, and everything was alright until I was redirected to a Flickr page saying I could only share photos if I was 13 or older. Then I realized: I got distracted and entered 2014 as my birthyear.

Ok, so I figured I could just head over to yahoo.com, login and change this info. This was actually MUCH tougher than it sounds. After logging into yahoo.com, I clicked the "Hi, Rodolfo" link at the top, as to edit my personal info to that account. It so happens I was kindly invited to create a Yahoo "Whatever" Profile so I can edit the very info just I filled TWO MINUTES ago. Not to mention that this is done as if there were not enough social networks profiles engines out there - I mean, who do you know uses Yahoo! Profiles in an regular basis??

So I just accepted the thing and searched again for what I wanted, to edit my info - I just hate it when apps make me do something twice just because "it's different systems"

But to my surprise, all I see in the Date of birth field is: NOTHING! Yeah, total 
blank space.

Being the web developer I am, I automatically fired up Chrome DevTools and saw that there were actually three hidden fields for each date component.

So I just edited the fields manually (entering numbers for each input value corresponding to my birthdate), and clicked Save. I'm glad it worked, or else I would just recommend against using Flickr or anything that is Yahoo's and write this blog post, but I'm just doing the latter.

Bad, bad service, Yahoo! No donut for you.
