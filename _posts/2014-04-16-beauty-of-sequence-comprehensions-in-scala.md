title: The beauty of sequence comprehensions in Scala
comments: true

While working through some [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net/) problems, I've found a quite nice solution to a problem using Scala's sequence comprehensions.

The problem was:

> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
> 
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Firstly, a palindrome number is one that reads both ways:

{% highlight scala %}
def pal(a: Int): Boolean =
  a.toString == a.toString.reverse
{% endhighlight %}

<!-- more -->

Then use a sequence comprehension to find all the palindrome products, filtering by the `pal` function:

{% highlight scala %}
def greatestPal(start: Int, end: Int): Int = {
  lazy val pals = for {
    x <- start to end
    y <- start to end
    if pal(x * y)
  } yield x * y

  pals.max
}
{% endhighlight %}

Reads nicely, huh?

And then you can get to the answer to this particular problem like this:

{% highlight scala %}
greatestPal(100, 999)

// 906609
{% endhighlight %}
